I occassionally get asked to facilitate conversations for the public about Shakespeare, offer introductory lectures on individual plays and theatre history, and comment on Shakespeare in contemporary performance. I take great joy in empowering audiences of all ages and background to engage with and claim Shakespeare as their own. Interested in collaborating? Do get [in touch](mailto:eetavares@ua.edu)!
