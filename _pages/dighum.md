Author, spy, political propagandist, Aphra Behn (1640–1689) was one of the first English women to earn a living by her pen. Set against the tumultuous backdrop of the English Civil Wars, expanding transatlantic slave trade, and settler colonialism in the Americas, Behn’s work engages with frankness and complexity a range of topics, from gender identity to political power.

This podcast celebrates the 350th anniversary of the first public performance of a work by Behn, surveying major trends across translations of romances and scientific texts, timely plays, erotic poetry, and an anti-slavery novella. Researched, written, and produced by University of Alabama undergraduates during the coronavirus global pandemic in the spring of 2021, this limited series provides the public with a primer to one of the most influential writers in English you’ve never heard of.

This project was featured as part of the National Humanities Alliance’s *Humanities for All* series, “[Making the Covert Public](https://humanitiesforall.org/blog/making-the-covert-public)” (15 June 2021), and in [a post](https://thewire.mla.hcommons.org/core-spotlight-making-the-covert-public-by-elizabeth-e-tavares/) for the Modern Language Association’s blog, *The Wire* (3 August 2021).
