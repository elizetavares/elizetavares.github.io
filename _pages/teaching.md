An avid teacher and mentor, I have developed courses in and lectured on British literature and history, ecodrama, Shakespeare in repertory, curation culture, critical race theory, and hashtag activism. Based on this work, my undergraduate mentees have pursued thesis projects bridging the discourses of dance, embodiment, and the Victorian novel; exploring the affective affordances of Sherlock Holmes fan fiction; teaching the many lives of King Henry VII; and tracing the history of editing grief in early modern dramatic representations of male mourning, among others. 

Are you considering graduate study in Renaissance literature? I'm interested in mentoring students looking to work on projects in theatre history, early modern performance, embodiment, ecocriticism, performance-based research and dramaturgy, Shakespeare in contemporary performance, and digital humanities.
