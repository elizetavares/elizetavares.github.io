Hi! I'm Elizabeth Tavares ([she/her](https://pronoun.is/she)), an interdisciplinary scholar of early modern English drama whose research foci include playing companies, theatre history, and Shakespeare in performance. I have the good fortune to serve as assistant professor of English at the [University of Alabama](https://english.ua.edu/people/etavares/), where I teach undergraduate and graduate courses for the [Hudson Strode Program in Renaissance Studies](https://strode.english.ua.edu/).

A three-time Mellon Foundation fellow, I've benefitted from research grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities; societies for Theatre Research and Renaissance Studies; and the Newberry, Folger, and Huntington libraries; among others. My prize-winning [scholarship](/_pages/publications.md) has appeared in *Early Theatre*, *Shakespeare*, *Shakespeare Bulletin*, *Shakespeare Quarterly* and *Shakespeare Studies*, as well as edited collections, special issues, and handbooks. A regular performance reviewer, I also contribute to academic blogs, vlogs, and podcasts.

I am currently at work on a book project, *Playing the Repertory before Shakespeare*, which, in tracing the development of the sixteenth-century repertory system, demonstrates how four major tacks — triptych blocking, up-cycled props, tailored soundscapes, and racialized prosthetics — were employed by companies to cultivate returner audiences. Other research interests include ecocriticism and critical editing.

Alongside these research endeavors, I am also a working dramaturg for productions of Shakespeare and new work. This includes serving as director-of-research for the [Alabama Shakespeare Project](https://alabamashax.org/), a performance-based research collective exploring early modern entertainments through a staged reading series and other events.

If you're interested, you can check out my [publications](/_pages/publications.md), [digital projects](/_pages/dighum.md), [dramaturgy credits](/_pages/dramaturgy.md), and (infrequent) [blog](http://bitethumbnails.com/) posts on issues related to repertory and contemporary performance trends. 

If you'd like to reach out, please do drop me a line via [email](mailto:eetavares@ua.edu). I look forward to hearing from you!
