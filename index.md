Elizabeth E. Tavares, PhD, [(she/her)](https://pronoun.is/she) is an interdisciplinary scholar of early modern English drama, whose research foci include playing companies, theatre history, and Shakespeare in performance. She is currently at work on her first book manuscript, *Playing the Repertory in Early Modern England*, which, in tracing the development of the sixteenth-century repertory system, demonstrates how four major tacks—triptych blocking, up-cycled props, tailored soundscapes, and racialized prosthetics—were employed by companies to distinguish their relative house styles and, by extension, cultivate returner audiences.

Tavares’s recent interests range from the role climatological phenomena played in the emergence of the professional playing companies and the place of victualing houses in sixteenth-century new play development, to the effects of content curation on early (modern) habits of mind. In addition to long-term collaborative book projects on these topics, she is developing digital humanities tools for purposes pedagogical and archival. Recent student-driven digital projects include Othello’s Crane: A Twitter Play (2017), Aphra Behn: The Podcast (2021), and a forthcoming mobile game for practicing scansion, SyllaBits, in collaboration with the department of Computer Science.

A three-time Mellon Foundation fellow, Tavares has received research grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities; societies for Theatre Research and Renaissance Studies; and the Newberry, Folger, and Huntington libraries. Tavares’s prize-winning scholarship has appeared in or is forthcoming from Early Theatre, Shakespeare, Shakespeare Bulletin, and Shakespeare Studies, among others, as well as several edited collections. A regular book and performance reviewer, Tavares has also contributed to numerous academic blogs, such as Humanities for All and Before Shakespeare, as well as vlogs and podcasts.

Tavares serves as director of research for the [Alabama Shakespeare Project](https://alabamashax.org/), a performance-based research collective exploring early modern entertainments through a staged reading series and other events. Other dramaturgy credits include a three-woman Macbeth at Portland Center Stage; consultancy with the Back Room Shakespeare Project and Original Practice Shakespeare Festival; Artists Repertory Theatre’s Feathers & Teeth, Magellanica, Teenage Dick, and The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart; as well as numerous audience-engagement lectures and post-show talk-balks.
